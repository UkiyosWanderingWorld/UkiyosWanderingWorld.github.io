            <h2 class="post-title">Another Day, Another Revelation</h2>
            <span class="post-meta">2025年3月10日</span>
            <div class="post-content">
                <p>
                    Last night I had many dreams (nothing out of the usual there)
                    the majority of which I couldn't remember in the slightest.
                    The usual sleep routine continues to plague my existence - adding a slight
                    bit more depth to my already deeply engraved eye shadows (At this rate 
                    we'll reach the mantle of my bones in a few weeks haha).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yes, the same ol' same ol'.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In recalling this now, how could I give voice to the rush of emotions welling
                    up inside me just a few hours prior - all the while the quickly stagnating silence 
                    being punctuated by the chicken-like squabblings of the last remaining coworker in 
                    the 教員室, seemingly tortured by the endless stream of unexpected surprises that 
                    come his way in the tizzying day-to-day operation of a prefectural high school.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yes, now it is just me and the quiet librarian taking notes on something I couldn't 
                    have the slightest idea of, the importance of which I have to wonder will forever
                    evade me... and with that, she is gone in a flash through the 引きドア (I learned
                    from a friend btw that this door is not a pull-type door, as you might expect, but 
                    rather a sliding-type).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this way, while thinking about things that have already escaped me, I am surrounded
                    by a world that refuses to stop moving. I suppose inertia is that sort of thing in the 
                    first place. More than that I consider whether reflection is even worth my while.
                    Whatever sequence of neuron firings that (I) somehow will to be through (volition?),
                    an afterimage of the world as it was, to this creature called by myself as "me," only a 
                    semblance of the reality that was then can be reconstructed. Even now, as I sit in 
                    quiet contemplation of these, if I may be honest, bizarre circumstances, I am constructing
                    not the original as I have intended, but something altogether new, informed by the present
                    moment - feeling, mood. While many would like to believe they act in complete 
                    accordance with their own desires - an individual of individuals, you might say - we 
                    are all still privy to the environment in which we are embedded. Even more than this are the 
                    physiological constraints that we operate within. Even now, my blood sugar level slowly wanes,
                    the caffeine I have consumed has already worn off due to the adenosine receptors having already 
                    upregulated to prepare for my daily dose at the same time of day. Like clockwork, what I felt 
                    in midst of a torrent of physiological changes I cannot accurately describe in my rather 
                    well-equilibriated present condition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the same time, however, in the midst of this quiet thought that I may call my very own, with 
                    this reflection I can take a moment to appreciate the change that has inevitably taken over me 
                    over say these past ten years as I soon enter the 30th year of my still young life. In those days 
                    when I came across such a fact of life I would've been prone to silent melancholy. If I may 
                    reinterpret those emotions in my present mind, such a feeling of 「しかたがない」was more defined 
                    by debilitating defeatism than it is now by blissful acceptance. This current me now sees this 
                    as an unescapable fact of life rather than an inevitable fate which prevents me from reaching
                    that aspired world of my dreams. To the me of now I consider such an accurate reconstruction
                    of the past to be the same type of process as that of reconstructing those dreams. Present circumstances
                    dictate what we are even able to recall of the past, near or however distant. Whatever mode of 
                    operation we enter into in the midst of our waking hours, from the intense focus I feel when 
                    writing this post now, to the constantly irritated, scatterbrained, and utterly disturbed state of 
                    mind I experienced yesterday afternoon. In one such way each state of mind is informed by physiological
                    processes that we can control to perhaps only an unsatisfactory degree.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shift. 休憩. My mind was getting carried away with a single thought and a change was needed, a rest.
                    while in the urinal, overlooking the same carbon-based, now long-past being effective in the least air-freshener
                    as always, I recall the words of one of the prefectural advisors at the Okayama JET orientation last 
                    Fall. 「挑戦」. The germ of the idea behind that simple utterance was precisely what the term itself 
                    implies: challenge. In the next moment, another word flashed through my mind - 「勇気」. The task that 
                    I had been ignoring for literal weeks suddenly I felt I just had to challenge myself to. The same 
                    emotions welling up as always once I dialed the number, the deliberate preparation of materials beforehand
                    to allieve the me of the moment from being at a loss of words - a developed trauma which has only deepened
                    with time. Despite all of these thoughts and feelings swirling inside me like a maelstrom, one 諺 came to 
                    mind: 「聞くは一時の恥、聞かぬは一生の恥」. In short, "To ask brings with it a moment of embarrassment, 
                    but not to ask is as a lifetime of embarrassment." This phrase, spinning within my head like a dredel released
                    from juvenile hands, acted as the final push to call. A simple phone call. One of many that occur each 
                    and every day. In my work I hear endless phones crying for attention - as an essential tool for information
                    transmission, a tool invented several hundred years prior, past the need for its advancement in the mid 2000s,
                    all the while still used varying due to custom and culture. Something as simple as this, I avoid like the 
                    plague.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenge. What really pushed me beyond the verge of no return? The final moment which separated decision from
                    indecision in the endless complex of neurons, muscle, proteins and tissues which constitute me, I am as yet 
                    unlearned enough to give a definitive answer. But in those critical moments, another thought, well, less a thought
                    and more a feeling informed by volition of days past: "I want to live here for the rest of my life."
                    Something as trivial as a phone call cannot stop me from achieving this dream. In a society which still 
                    operates heavily under the influence of the communication method of the humble phone call, I have 
                    no other choice but to challenge myself to uncondition myself from this fear. Even now I don't 
                    think my mind and body are in alignment with processing the call itself.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Yet after all this is said, the most incredible thing happened - nothing at all. In moments when I did 
                    not understand my phone partner the first time, I employed my language skills to ask again. Despite
                    not understanding even after offering a response to the second time it was stated, through a bit 
                    more communication, an agreement was achieved, a time set, hairstylist determined. In short - 
                    mission accomplished. In shorter short: I learned essential phrases that employees use in such
                    exchanges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I move through my day, as my body continues to revolve around this concept of "homeostasis,"
                    as I once again forget my water bottle and feel the effects of slight dehydration, I can at least
                    sit for a quiet moment in a feeling of accomplishment. One obstacle in the path. One challenge 
                    during the climb. For a moment, I can wrap all of my fears, my emotions warped from times past 
                    together with my dreams, the things that I aspire for whenever in the future, into a delicious meal 
                    that I may call "peace."

                    Hello there, and welcome to the floating world. My name is Sean and I will be your
                    somewhat less than reliable host. Regardless the walk of life you come from, I hope
                    you will enjoy your stay. Rest-assured, I'd like to make it worth your while.

                    Stating these things outright feels a bit heavy-handed, but I'd like to outline my
                    rather scatterbrained goals in this first post. I suppose a bulleted list will do:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Anything and anything that comes to mind</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Okay! So with that, please take a seat, grab a drink, and I hope you enjoy your stay. Cheers!
