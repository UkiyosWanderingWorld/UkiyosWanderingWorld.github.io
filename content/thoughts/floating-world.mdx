Last night I had a number of dreams. Nothing out of the ordinary there, yet 
none of which I could remember either in the least.

The usual sleep routine continues to hang over me like a plague, or perhaps
more like a massive crane, carving out the bags of my eyes ever deeper. Oh!
how they gently deflect inward, folding under a weight both from within and without.

Yes, the same as usual.

I recall this now, a rush of emotions boiling over my head.
Minutes removed from that time, how could I possibly give voice to that 
which was lost just a moment before?

A torrent of seemingly unforeseen circumstances arising, chit-chattering serving
as a soft birdsong of the final coworker in the lounge. Just a little bit afterward 
now, and it is but the librarian frantically checking something remaining.

And me. I'm nearly nodding off as if in a daze, a malaise of quiet rumination.

In doing so, I think to myself - surrounded by a world always trudging forward - 
inertia being just that sort of thing in the first place. In such a world do I remain, 
a quiet, almost ghostly visage of that elapsed time just before. In these quiet 
times I sit with him, like with the childhood friend I am afraid of losing forever.

In truth, several months have passed, and in looking at the rough draft from that 
time I wince almost out of instinct. 

Too wistful.

Too pedantic.

Too dated.

...

With each qualm I have with the stream of thoughts from that time. i endeavor to reconvey.
to retell in a voice that i am somehow lead to believe reflects the me of now more than yesterday.
When i really consider it, i am no different from this ever-changing world. A floating world.

What this blog endeavors to convey, even now i couldn't tell you exactly. consider what is created
here as a sort of beast, quivering at the sight of the cage door open, loosely hung. what was good 
about confinement was its safety. what lies outside isn't guaranteed.

Welcome to my world. If you will have me, i'd like to drift if only for a little while.

Together.
