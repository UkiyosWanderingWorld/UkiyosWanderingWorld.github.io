せせら笑う. My colleague and wonderful co-teacher heard me reading this word out loud, and with her response to my voice a pleasant chat began. Sometimes a single comment said with intention can become the spark of a conversation, the flame which, with enough intentionality as the fuel, grows into a pleasant chat.

It's funny, what chemicals we place into our bodies, how underlying processes play out according to internal rhythms, and how those rhythms are themselves a consequence of our surroundings. The never-ending feedback loop of life is enough to keep us going while we live - perhaps. It's been a week since I went to Kyoto, and each time I go (this was the fourth time already in less than a year's time) I grow to enjoy it all the more. Be it due to the laid-back nature of my friend who welcomes me, or perhaps it is just the energy of the city which I find myself attracted to - or maybe as a vacation that in and of itself is enough to foment my momentary solace. Whatever the case may be, this time was no different, perhaps even the best visit yet.

...

Yesterday the total at the register was off by a single yen. I quip, almost under my breath "Kind of an inconvenient amount, isn't it?" to the attendant - a quiet, nearly hidden laugh ensues. My fate, however, was sealed with what I will call the 'carton of woe,' a sugar-less maelstrom of proteins ill-matched to my body, an arch-enemy in the making.

Yesterday was the day I realized I'm allergic to almonds.

It did not help that I had only consumed, up until the lunch hour, a single cup of coffee, but somehow in the afternoon's rehearsal for the next day's Open School I felt especially off. It's hard to describe really, but if I were to put it into words it's almost like the feeling of accidentally walking into a patch of poison ivy, except if every surface of every membrane in your body was exposed to the stuff. This naturally extends to the brain, and the ensuing neurological symptoms were enough to make me want to launch myself into the nurse's office. Truly nasty work, allergies are.

...

 The sunflowers at the Kyoto Botanical Gardens were the icing on what was already a delicious cake. My friend having a convention they were attending for the day followed by a skin appointment meant that I had the whole day to myself. It's not in my nature to create rigid plans (which is why when I do construct them it either feels too forced or the realization of it falls apart by the third step), and having been exhausted from the previous work-week, I ended up doing what I do best - playing it by ear. At the very least, from previous visits the Botanical Garden was high on my list for places to see.

Needless to say, all of the pieces seemed to come together, that evening I simply basked in the joy I received from those wonderful plant friends. I am writing this several weeks after, at this point I've lost track, but even now when I am in a reflective mood I think back fondly to that garden, to that greenhouse. Each and every moment I relished as much as possible, and now as I sit at my desk in the teacher's lounge I wonder how I can create such a joy in my "normal" life, removed from such a relaxed and resplendent time, relished to its fullest.

Yes, now in the teacher's lounge I sit, struggling for breath, having drunk my second cup of coffee (it's still only 11AM) as my back begins to ache and my head feels just a tad bit fuzzy. Three and two days prior I decided to do some slightly more heavy weight training, and that, on top of some four odd poisons (sugar, gluten, alcohol and heat) rendered me utterly useless the days immediately following. Even now I still recover. Yet 'utterly useless,' as an expression seems to be completely lacking in its ability to evoke the deluge of torment I felt. A tiredness that steals not just energy in its loosest sense, but opportunity in the form of a hopeful outlook, like a hitch-hiker left ignored on the side of the road for hours on end. Eventually, people reach their limit - a breaking point. This tiredness, combined with the mental cacophony that constitutes trepidation layered on top of the regret of reticence from social involvement, a sign of executive malfunction, perhaps? Dysphoria distending, it eats me from within, a cancer quietly rotting me from the core.

I apologize for the visceral language, but when it comes to expressing the grief that arises from disability, namely, the stealing of meaningful opportunities, I find no other words to be appropriate. When my mind enters into a realm filled with haze, these ominous clouds welling up from some unseen source, the expressive power that I lose I don't believe can be expressed in language. We can come close, but with such approximations we may never be able to draw more near. Quietly, I lament my human limits. Somberly I sit in discomfiting silence.

Where to go from here? Mind, with all its faculties, can catch the thread of thought and dictate what is to come next, generate some continued line of thought, whether it be reasoning or mere association. From this place I see many possible paths to take, yet it is always trepidation which leads me to choose the most undesirable - the path which arises when the rest are forsaken, not out of direct choice, but out of fear towards that which will be lost. Every decision is a choice - a choice which implies the inevitable occlusion of some finite number of options. For every moment spent in pause, contemplating what to do next, something is lost, that potential slips through the fingers like sand. Despite this known truth I sit as always in stormy rumination.

Through such thoughts I understand Sapir-Whorf to be false. What is stronger of the two, language or the mind, in terms of leverage over the other, there can be no mistake that the determiner of one's experienced reality is not ultimately language. Language is a product of mental process, which itself is a product of one's environment as well as to a limited extent one's own actions. While yes, the language that is used appears to mould what one thinks about the world, how one creates a model for reality, in reality the full picture is a bit more muddied. We as mindbodies are the conduit for cognitive process, let alone lived experience, and language is but one mode of that process's manifestation. Colloquially speaking, "there is more underneath the surface," is the belief I want to get across. More often than not that language feels like a hindrance, if not an outright trap, leads me to consider what lies a bit deeper under our shared experience. If anything, there are deeper aspects of psychology as well as social behavior which are not reflected in the language in which these actions are conveyed. Actions, rather, Rules. Conduct. Expectation. Before we put such concepts into words we feel them, we intuit their reality before us. What language does, then is adds on to that process, not foment its basis.

Yet again I am associating, losing perhaps the point (if there was one?) entirely, but this gives me pause when continuing to learn this language, namely, Japanese. That is to say, what I truly err'd in from the start was underestimating the conduct which is expected in this culture - that isn't something which arises from the language itself, now is it? 

A lot can be said for interfacing with a foreign culture. What I will say about it now is that despite a language being a means to interface with it, that on its own is never the end-all-be-all. One important aspect of this relation is the willingness to open up to a different way of thinking. More than that is the germ of the idea which differs, the root of what constitutes the sociological fabric. That certainly can be translated, but whether it is truly received is another thing all-together. That is the mysterious force underneath different languages which we call 'culture.' 

With this idea in mind, what I am presently contending with when it comes to continuing to learn the language is precisely the culture which uses it. Specifically, that expression of ideas must conform to conduct and custom - not the other way around. Namely, what I wish to say is not always what I should convey, and how I do it is potentially more important, else I risk attracting the ire of my peers. The way social relationships are structured, the way one proceeds through the levels of social relation, the way one relates to those who are younger and older, how one expresses oneself to their boss versus their best friend - of course all of this differs to an extent in English. But these differences in conduct, baked into the language itself, are the thing which is so difficult for me to grasp. Specifically, that the grammar itself changes depending on situation, the words one should use and what one should call their peer, or even how to refer to their peer depending on the situation, I fear will forever evade me. What is also critical, perhaps moreso in this language than in my native tongue, is what is left unsaid, and the positive mistrust of language that seems apparent in this reticence to speak. Thus, the language with it's grammar and vocabulary is certainly difficult, but the metalinguistic aspects? A lifetime living here, living in these communities, buying into the ideology, finding a partner, however I live my life here, on and on until the day I die, I do not think I will be able to master. That is what gives me pause; that is what makes me think about whether to press further on along this path.

To this end, I suppose I am selfish. We all are, in a way, but it is through my behaviour that I feel I fall short of the expectations of Japanese society. Not that there were any in the first place seeing as how I am just a foreigner, a guest in this country. But when I think about actually integrating? The goal-posts shift and the bar is raised. At this age of 30 years old, am I ready to play into that game? What game am I here to play, if any? In a sense that is an inevitability, no matter the country from which you come. It's more a matter of which rules am I more willing to play within. However, if it's any consolation, there are some further truths that need to be put into words:

1. I have been learning this language for roughly four years now
2. I have been living in this country for just over a year now
3. Japan being approximately 97% ethnically Japanese (as of 2024)
4. It is not easy to learn a language when using  your native language is a part of your job duties.

Points three and four do not help with language learning, nor integration, and points one and two show that when it comes to duration of lived experience with respect to Japan's language and culture, in the grand scheme of things I do not have much. Considering these items, some leniency is more than due - not only that, but it is a survival tool when living abroad. It's probably best to give myself a break there.

However, be that as it may, I certainly do have my doubts about my continued existence here. Despite these doubts though, I can still enjoy my time here. I can still find something of value, and more than that, endeavor to keep long term connections, connections that persist even if I decide not to live here in the future. As I draw this blog post to a close, I hope that the radiance of those sunflowers that I saw at the Kyoto Botanical Garden can infect me with a kind of good will - the kind that is infectious and spreads to everyone around me. Despite the torment that I may subject myself to, or that which comes from natural consequences beyond my control, I shouldn't forget that continuing to wake up everyday, continuing to live despite everything, is itself a choice, indeed perhaps one of the most important choices we make each and every day.
