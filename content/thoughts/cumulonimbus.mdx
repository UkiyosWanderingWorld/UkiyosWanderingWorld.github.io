The other day suddenly rain fell. From earlier in the day weather forecasters
were coming to grips with an unstable atmosphere - a well-established high
to the south, a growing low just to the north. My city, wedged in the middle,
was bound for nothing else but a stormy night. 

Within the torrential downpour, a strange feeling seemed to well up. Almost 
as if the axis of the Earth had been flipped, thunderclouds rolled lazily,
with quiet fury to the west. Yet only the sound of splashing water droplets
on the features of the land could be heard - a white noise ushering in the night.

It takes time for me to understand my emotions - I get easily overwhelmed by crowds.
inside every single person is this turbulent mass of entities acting at times,
despite their own interests, together. As tissues. Membranes. And this isn't 
even to begin talking about that thinking organ. Alas, two's company, three's a crowd.

Just before my stop I am almost in tears. I'm reading 'Sewing Machine and Goldfish' by Nagai Mimi, 
and putting aside for now my frustration at first with the floaty, colloquial language used to set 
the stage, I happen to read this passage:

>ええっと。おとっつぁんは、箱職人だったのよね。箱職人ってゆうのは、厚紙の上に型紙置いて線引いてそれを
>切って組み立てたやつにきれいな和紙や布を粘って、まんじゅうやら砂糖でできた鯛やらを入れてお祝い用に
>すんだけど、箱職人は職人の中でも一等ビリで、鳶とか左官なんかに盛り場であうと、かならず小馬鹿に
>されっちゃう。だから家でその分えばっておっかさんを殴ってたって。理屈はないんだけど、ただ八つ当たりで
>殴ってた、って。そのせいでおっかさんは鼓膜が破れて、破れて時に内っ側に飛んだ血が目の裏に溜まって、
>目が半分以上見えなくなったって。でもおっかさんはなんも言わず医者にも行かずがまんしてて、おかしいな
>とおもったばあさんが姑のばあさんが医者に連れてったときは、耳も目も手遅れだったって。明治女はがまん
>づよいかった。がまんしてがまんして、苦労して苦労してあたしおうんですぐ死んじゃった。

Loosely translating:

> umm, so my dad was a box maker. His job was basically to make decorative boxes used for
> celebrations, you know the one's you'd put manju or sweetened sea bream in. However, box makers
> were the worst among craftsmen, so he'd end up being looked down upon by the construction 
> workers or the plasterers if they happened to cross paths on the street. As if to compensate for that,
> he beat my mom. It's not like there was any other reasoning behind it or anything, he just did it
> to take out his anger. Because of that, my mom's ear drums burst, the blood flying so far as
> the backs' of her eyes, pooling just like that. She could barely even see half out of them after that.
> However, without saying anything nor even going to a doctor, she just took it. My grandmother,
> my mother's mother-in-law, couldn't just stand by without doing anything, so she ended up bringing
> her to a doctor after all, who told them it was already too late for her eyes and ears. Showa women
> can really put up with a lot, huh? Grandma was pretty strong like that though. And so was mom. But
> after just putting up with it and putting up with it, suffering piling atop suffering like that,
> just after I was born she died.

As I translate this now, despite the mainly cognitive task at hand, I can't help but nearly cry. I had 
a thought about this a bit earlier today, that something about reading it in another language, even if I'm
not native, getting even to such a meager point as this at which I can discern even this meaning from it, it's
as if a second set of weights has been placed on my mind. Not that I could ever come to understand it precisely
as a native-speaker could. And yet I feel a slight tremor as my heart strings twinge ever so slightly. We are exposed
to and end up reading a truly horrid number of tragedies in our daily lives that the only natural outcome, if
things are left as they are, is to become desensitized. Not that this is a new thought of course, but at the very least
being present with it, actually *sitting* with it is something we all should bear in mind.

It's long past the point at which I think I can muster up a coherent thought, much less edit many of them into something
eloquent, much less consistent, so I should stop there. I continue to struggle with expression. Presence in the moment.
These harbored emotions swim within me, living on like the sea creatures who call the ocean floor their home.
Let them sit, let them be still. They'll be given their time to surface one day.
