The other day I went to an island called Naoshima, located in the Seto island
Sea here in Japan. Something as simply as swimming in a salty ocean amongst 
seaweed, jellyfish and friends was quite nice. Quite, quite nice.

I've been wondering lately, as I have for the past 6 or 7 
odd years, about why I'm here. When I think about the
discontent that lies in the hearts of so many people nowadays and throughout 
history, I feel both comforted and disparaged. Ultimately I understand that 
all it takes is a leap of faith - how else do people figure out what to do 
next with themselves? I tend to have a blind spot there, where otherwise people
seem to feel this assurance of their will. Perhaps less a blind spot and moreso
a crater, creating a hollowed out me from within.

My thought process is either one of extreme linearity with no wiggle room otherwise
or an associative maze with no end. I often list things that I like, and yet I do 
not do them. Rather, I write my lament as to the lack of my action toward doing them.
Each and every time I consider doing something new, I am filled to the brim with a 
single emotion - pause. So much so that the tendency that has developed is to wait 
for the will of others to wash over me like a tide. I allow myself to be taken in 
by that voiceless strength, and I, like a limp piece of seaweed, simply wave back 
and forth according to the desire of the current.

Attention span is shot, each and every day I dredge from the bottom of my reserves 
the will to continue, to put the mask on for yet another day. When I have a quiet 
moment to myself, I am caught between the relief of allowing myself to pause and 
become aware of myself. My surroundings. what am i really doing here? what are 
these people to me? how am i helping the world? Caught between these thoughts and 
an uncanny shame that I'm not doing enough. I drive myself as if with no compass 
of my own possession, but by one which is held by everyone but me. No internal 
heading, aimlessly I drive, almost as if the tires are spinning in-place, the only 
trace of my efforts the burnt rubber atop the scorched earth.

It's unfortunate really. Perhaps even laziness. More than that, however, I'd like to 
believe is Fate. Fate is the underlying mechanism and I move according to it's hidden 
devices. My lament, my woes, when will I come to terms with this Lot? If only I could
do so, I would reach the next stage which is acceptance. Paradoxically, it may very 
well be faith in this Lot which may help me come to peace in this life. What has 
come of it so far. And it may very well be this acceptance, not some sort of strength 
of will, which could finally open the door to my future. 

Passively, I think such a thing.

A thought just came to mind. I never studied astronomy but only dabbled in it. In 
the constellations I have astrology to thank. For the solar system I have my early 
education to feel gratitude toward. As for the deep space objects I have my innane 
curiosity to blame as well as my major having been physics after all.

When it was, I cannot remember, but at some point I longed if even briefly for a 
hobbyist telescope. You know, the ones which, depending upon the model can even track 
a particular object in the sky throughout the night. I watched Youtube video upon 
Youtube video of reviews and demonstrations of various models. Longing for something 
I realistically would never come to buy, how characteristically me.

As if it were a unifying theme, the interest in telescopes, astronomy, and the greater 
mystery of cosmology was all a passing intrigue. Among many others. Origami, coffee,
mathematics, aerodynamics, radio-controlled cars, programming, and neuroscience. 
And now Japanese and languages. All were relevant for a time, spanning say 2, maybe 3
years on up to 5 take or leave an extra year. Yet despite their variety and somewhat
varied scope, they all end up amalgamated under the same solid truth - their end. To put 
it differently, my interest in them fading away. Hours spent pouring over textbooks,
lecture notes and personal notes to write a proof that's been written before. Years spent
writing and re-writing code that contained barely enough functionality to be called an 
'application' in the first place. For several years when I was young, being forced into 
situations in which I had no choice but to wait, to sit still. I folded water bomb bases,
water lillies, cranes, dragons, variations on that same theme. Hundreds of models, all of 
a crude quality. All this I say as I recall in a quiet moment of present discontent, sitting 
on my bed-couch, complacently clacking away at worn-out keys. No one needs to know these 
things - even if the quality of writing were half-way decent in the first place, the content
is simply one person's lament toward a life so-far wasted. Of personal weakness, of trepidation
and constant pause. There is plenty more life to live, of course, and yet momentum is a powerful
thing to resist. A big change inspires only a temporary alteration in behavior before similar 
habits are reformed. Worse still, when such large changes do occur they are usually brought about 
by someone else in my life, according to their desires and wishes. I merely hang on while, in the 
quiet corners of my heart I wish that this experience will inspire me to change in my day-to-day 
life as well.

And yet it never does.

In realizing this, i come to believe that the only way forward, the only way to make progress is 
not with so small a change as to be negligible but with something so drastic i cant help but feel 
like im taking a leap of faith. And yet the result is always the same. I ride the coattails of the 
novelty of that experience until i find a kind of minimal existence in my new home. I become complacent, lazy. 
Whether the grounder truth is maintenance of friendships and livelihood or having any sort of dream in the 
first place, i do not know. I do not think humans are constructed upon such dichotomies. The world itself is 
one of contextual truth, or rather, we as intelligent beings generate truth according to experience, in addition 
perhaps to some baked in rules from the start. Some people are better at finding that thing in them that screams ‘this’ 
when they search for their reason to keep going. Some people are more accepting of their circumstances, regardless of 
whether they like it or not. Some people will forever yearn, never satisfied, and die as if in a torrent, caught in a 
maelstrom of unsatisfied desire. I fear that i am the lattermost case.

Whatever the case may be, there is still the issue of communication, and honestly, I am so tired of it. 
So tired of saying what I suppose would count as lies in a court of law, to such a degree I say what is against 
what I feel. I agree to things I don't agree with. In the least, in the very least. I force myself 
to communicate with people I do not wish to communicate with in a position which I realize I do not want to be in. 
So. let that be okay, admitting to a personal truth every once in a while will not kill you I suppose. 
My reason, then, for being here? Knowing what I know now, about myself, my immediate surroundings and this greater 
world around me, I think I can answer very simply. While I am here, I want to find a practice. 
Whether it be practice in day-to-day life, or practice in a trade, a calling, what have you, I want to find 
peace in something I can continue with, something that will hopefully outlast my lifespan. Something that
may very well have come before my lifetime as well.

The solution, well, it is simple to say, yet difficult to communicate. I resign. That decision can be made 
quite early on. After that? Well, I should prepare for that now I suppose.

Well carry on then, that's it for today.
