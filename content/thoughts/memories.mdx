It was only a few years ago that I would frequently get this, shall I say mawkish, intensely nostalgic feeling whenever I had free time. Cutting into the crust of my memories, I would penetrate into the mantle, a hot soup of remnants from such a relatively long time ago that they may as well be illusions to my present mind. 

Every time the topic of conversation turns to ‘earliest memories’ the farthest back I can conjure up in my brain is a broken web of near hallucinations from when I was about four years old. Only a few words are enough to construct that brittle lattice. Blue Triumph (old British Sports car), Cedarburg Winery (further south, closer to the water fall) inside an old consignment or antique shop of some kind. My father picks me up from school at that time. I think it is a sunny clear day with puffy cumulus sitting nearly perfectly still in a nearly calm blue sky. 

Anything beyond that description I believe would be confabulation. I cannot recall accurately more than this. This is the latest surviving memory in my mind, patchwork as it may be. Beyond this, if I really think for a second, consciously considering triggers in my mind, a quilt-work of other memories begin to resurface. Driving to the cabin with my brother and August - my brother asks me about the JET program. We take the scenic route and it’s a beautiful day, the sun peeking through the semi-translucent greenery that surrounds us. 木漏れ日は綺麗だね。After some ups and downs along the gorge path my brother and I stop on a dusty stone escarpment overlooking the Columbia river. The wind whipping what without our hats our hair would be obscuring our eyes, we take a couple of selfies (自撮り) before continuing our journey. It’s night-time and after the jealousy from my girlfriend of the time not spending time with me, having grown throughout the night finally boiling over, it consumes me, and I erupt in rage before storming off to my car and peeling away from her home. After a fun albeit somewhat awkward first date filled with perhaps self-hatred, sarcasm, and fatalistic irony, the sky releases buckets of rain and I have no choice but to stay the night at her place. I do not sleep a wink as I avoid touching any part of her, afraid of judgement and repercussion if any accident were to happen. We do not talk after that. We’re running around the fields behind my Elementary School and I see one of the fastest students outpacing me, yet I’m always striving to reach his pace. I sprint to the finish line after my first 5K, gasping desperately for air. The sweat falling like a waterfall off of my back as I play some competitive points of tennis with my friend, who never beats me yet always strives to. One of my brother’s friends drinks 12 Mountain Dews at a little Badminton tournament we organized in my other friend’s backyard. I sit in my car at 10 or 11 at night waiting for the high to fade off after running away suddenly from my friend’s house, afraid that I’ll be caught by my parents. Rage after successfully getting pizza with a coworker who was very adamant to get it with me, and who also appeared to be recruiting me into their Pentecostal Sect. The Christian ring that, at the time of buying it in a famous market in Korea, sinks to the bottom of a canal near Kibitsu Shrine, having just been tossed in there decidedly by me.

I could go on of course, as this sampling of things that I have done or that have been done to me occupies not even half of a percent of the memories which lay dormant inside of me. Even less than the sheer volume of experiences that I have had in the thirty years of my life up until this point. Yet with their episodic nature, I continuously ask myself whether I feel they are truly a part of me, or whether they contribute to a tapestry that somehow exists outside, beyond myself. Am I the sum of these memories? Do they form the basis of who I am, or am I something which ostensibly exists beyond them, or within an entirely different realm altogether? How should we think of memories when we consider what constitutes who we are? In my twenties (yes I can say that now) I would think ad nauseum about what makes me me, I existed in a world possessed of a positive spirit toward introspection, oftentimes getting lost within the web of thought, of dubious rationality, concerning these matters of existence, purpose, and so on. Yet now that I have entered the third decade of my life, what preoccupies my mind? 

If I were to put it succinctly, it would be this: a sense in the back of my mind of panic - that I am running out of time. Of course assuming the average life expectancy for males in the US, despite falling in the past few years, I still have more than half of my life before me. However, culturally we learn of the scope of one’s lifetime, of one’s career, at least as far as how it should be lived in the past 100 years or so. That internalized narrative makes many assumptions, for example one starting with “by the age of thirty one should…,” where in place of the ellipses there is usually a judgement surrounding income, career, academics, marriage, child-rearing, etc.. What this narrative does is construct an expectation, a mold that one must fit within. How one should live their life. And when one breaks the mold? Well, as to the crime so too to the punishment, and in general one feels this malaise originating from this sense as to their unfittedness to the society within which they were raised. It can be an unspoken judgement, or even a comment which is positively intended, yet riddled with false assumptions. Or perhaps the goalposts differ.

Within this discussion, the germ of what I wish to say is this: causatively I am not sure, but I feel this vague sense of urgency which grows ever more prescient as the days pass. For one reason, as stated above, by these external pressures becoming internalized, and as another, due to illness. This past week I have gone through a number of strange medical affairs, stretching as far as having to see a Urinologist for some pain in my groin area, to developing a rash which covered my entire body, perhaps from a pistachio mont-blanc, yet regardless something which I have as yet never experienced once within my life. With the number of ailments on average during the year piling up, in-general feeling less ‘well’ than in my twenties, surprise allergies popping up like weeds, I begin to grow uneasy. “How long will the times of good health last” is a thought which, having already germinated in my mind, steadily grows in the corners of the very same organ. Each month the anxiety expands, despite my efforts to quell it.

I realize that with internalizing society’s expectations, you will never find happiness. In other words, like so many before me have said, creating goals based off of external factors is a sure-fire way to fail in the end. I try to resist this in my own thinking, yet the tendency is one of becoming negative, certainly unproductive. So here’s what I wish to tackle in this decade of my life - how can I live more authentically, in-alignment with my values, with what I care about, while acknowledging my existence within society, in addition to my dependence on it? I don’t know what it will take, but judging from the past ten years of my life at least I can say with certainty that it requires a greater proportion of action to thinking than I have done up-to-this-point. Also, the development of thinking that more closely matches practical, lived experiences, for example when planning a vacation. Indeed it seems this will be the decade where I delineate the contours of what Praxis means for me.
