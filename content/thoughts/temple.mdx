the 'light l' and the 'dark l' are allophones of the same phoneme in English: /l/. I read this fact yesterday while preparing for my lessons, and I still don't understand it. Any fact like this which is presented before us yet defies our understanding, I think there are a couple things you can do with it. You can sit with it for a time, gnaw at it, and then let it be for a time before trying once again. Or you can simply give up. Of course there are many variations in-between, my posing the situation as though there were only two possible responses is a little trick of the persuader's hand, but to me these are the most prominent choices.

A fact that isn't understood immediately takes time and other resources to come to terms with. This reminds me of another video I watched the other day, in which a professor was amicably admonishing a student for their absence while offering them some life advice. Note that this video was entirely Japanese, and moreover it could have been staged - in either case after working through the translation, the professor's point became clear. To start, however, the student's absence prompted a discussion around the real heart of the matter: the student didn't understand how formulae in economic theory would be useful to him later on down the road. The professors final, albeit somewhat hackneyed, response was this. That you don't know how useful any piece of knowledge, learning will be later in your life. But the moment it does, you'll understand how it connects then.

Thinking about this for a bit, it really is useful advice, despite ignoring other glaring material conditions of college students in Japan (among many other parts of the world). At the time of watching, it reminded me of a conversation that I had with a colleague of mine about my former German teacher. Despite the fact that I had since gone to college in the sciences, extensively studied computer science and neuroscience since then, I've somehow wound up in language education. I couldn't have had the slightest clue that learning German, the language itself, would prove to be useful in some way later. And yet it was. The moment I started planning lessons for my classes, the memories of how she conducted her lessons came to my mind. They formed a basis, among other things I have learned and experienced, which allowed me to come up with a game-plan and execute it.

Lacking an understanding for why we should do what we will do tomorrow, to me comes down to a few factors. At least in-terms of the present day, one correlating factor appears to be that of the internet. Especially in the last ten years, what with the development and rapid adoption of short form content, such ever-increasingly addictive systems serve to distract us from matters that we should be watching with a careful eye. Moreover, they tend to act as pacifiers to a burnt-out society, an advancement on the scheme laid-out by bars, casinos, strip-clubs and the like. Commercialization of leisure was the blueprint, the development of infrastructure of the Internet laid the groundwork for the iPhone, which itself was a monumental moment in human history which sowed the seeds of discord, which germinated only a few years later. Along the way in that germination process was the development and massive popularity of Vine. As a mimetic process, other people formed start-ups looking to imitate the success that Vine achieved. Other information hubs such as Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit (later dubbed 'social media networks'), popped up over the years and gained traction in the Public. Tiktok's striking rise was more of the same, but accelerated ever faster. All of these developments have led to today, a time in which it is difficult for many of us to imagine a life without our phones at our sides at all times. We constantly check our dms, like posts, listen to podcasts on Spotify, message friends. In short, we preoccupy our downtime with touches, taps, flicks, and thumb gestures, gazing fixedly until we stop arrives, or until our next meeting shows up.

Under all of this is the carefully constructed narrative by the corporations that produce our beloved devices that we demand or even need them or social media in our lives. That they wouldn't continue making them unless there was no demand for them. But this is just a feint, a smoke-screen if you will. App and product designers talk often about 'engagement' but I want you who is reading this to interpret this as what it really is: addiction. 'boosting engagement' 'promoting engagement' 'optimizing viewers' 'ad-revenue' is just a business-like language that hides what social media sites, as well as creators, really do: create technology, create Documents which aim to bring us back time after time to the same application or website or page or whatever. All of this 'engagement' talk is predicated on the profit-motive of such creators and developers. It is indicative of an unhealthy society to continue moving forward with very little resistance, much less buy-in, to such schemes.

Unfortunately for many of us, it's a very difficult habit to kick. We have our neurochemistry to blame for that. That in conjunction with our evolution as hyper-social beings. Though we may wish to remove ourselves from the devices that harm us, social forces form the final barrier to exit. Here I try to imagine how people communicated with their friends, say, 50 years ago. Sure at that time there was radio, television, and telephones, but all of these telecommunication devices were fixed in their location. Socially this implies that there is no pressure to respond immediately. To a friend in distress. To a lover who wants to break up with you. To your employer. At that time, the time-scale of social obligation was longer than it is today. At that timescale, you could go about your day, take a phone-call when you pleased, watch the news when you get home, etc. To me it seems there was, even at that time, just a bit more space to breath, to live your life, to be social with people as you meet them during the day. In stark contrast, smartphones, social/tele-work apps like slack and teams, imply an accelerating need for urgency. That every problem, be it technical, business, or socially-related, need be solved immediately. Our technology has enabled us to communicate as such anyway. To go against this urgency, despite seeming at first to be a breach in the modern social contract, to me can be a concrete means of resisting an inertia that is bringing us closer and closer to societal collapse. Of course, then, what becomes important is spending that time away from our devices deliberately, which itself is more an art than a science.

Perhaps then, to bring things back full circle to where I started today, deliberate living can be a means to finding our way through a chaotic, unpredictable future. In this deliberateness there is also the setting up of boundaries. Again, with one's workplace (be it a 9-to-5 or even to freelance and 'content-creator' roles), with one's friends, and with one's family. We all need time to rest, relax, and even to be on our own, without mulling too much over our worries. Rather, we need time to make sense of a seemingly insane world, to consciously slow ourselves down when we feel the deluge of the roaring flood of society's screams and shouts rushing cleanly past our own doorstep. Maybe, and just maybe, through quiet reflections, we'll come to the realization of how our past learning, that is to say our past experiences, come to connect with our present selves. This insight, I believe, is something that slips through the cracks of a quiet countryside home, whispering as the creaking of the oak boards underfoot. I still do not know how the l in 'low' is allophonic to the final l in 'lull,' but in life's lulls I can find time to consciously approach this problem anew. That is one place where real-insights can be found.
